I've been working on moving <a href="http://keepflippin.com">this</a> to <a href="http://symphony-cms.com">this</a>. It's got a bit of a learning curve, but I would say it's like Rails for designers with a GUI. That's not a bad thing. The bad thing is that it uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT 1.0</a>. Which is the least powerful language ever written (spec was written 8 years ago). It's not a procedural language, and if you don't treat it as one, you'll be ok.

Some posts about tutorials will follow.
