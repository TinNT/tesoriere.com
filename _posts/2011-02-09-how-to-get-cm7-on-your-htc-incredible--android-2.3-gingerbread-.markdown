## Why this is important and why I am not responsible for your phone exploding :(

I originally switched from an iPhone 3GS to the HTC Incredible because ATT was [molesting](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/02/11/) my wallet. Only, I discovered the default OS wasn't too responsive, and there was a ton of crap on it. Aside from that, I didn't really have any complaints, and so enter custom roms and [Cyanogen Mod 7 (CM7)][1] 
and the point of this article.

CM7 is a customizable, nearly universal [Gingerbread/Android 2.3][2] ROM. There's a port for almost each Android device that can be [rooted][3]. A phone being rooted is something akin to jailbreaking an iPhone. It just let's you do more stuff. I'm not talking about you pirates :(

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN!

Please note than this will start your phone fresh, so you might considering [backing up all of your data](http://www.tested.com/news/complete-guide-to-backing-up-your-android-phone/423/) if you don't already have a backup. To make a backup of your apps, please consider using [AppBrain](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.appspot.swisscodemonkeys.apps).

## How do I do it?

To install the rom is fairly easy. You have to (1) root the phone, and (2) install the rom. I won't explain it step by step, because there are plenty of resources. To begin, please read about more of the [terminology and disclaimers here][3]. 

1.  **Rooting the phone**. The software to do it is called Unrevoked Forever and can be [downloaded here][4]. After download the software, the process is described in detail at [their website, unrevoked.com][5]. It's just involves running the programs, and clicking through the prompts. 

2.  **Downloading CM7**. You can either download [Rom Manager](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager) after the phone is rooted and download CM7 through there, which is located under Cyanogen nightly, or [download it here](http://mirror.teamdouche.net/?type=nightly&device=inc), copy it to the phone and use Rom Manager to install it. Supposedly #29 is stable, I'm on an earlier version and everything works fine.


If you get past step one, which you should, you can backup your current phone (which is one nice thing about rooting) as a [nandroid backup](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?title=Howto:_Using_the_Recovery#NANDroid_backups), which is akin to an iTunes iPhone backup, and always revert back to it if nothing works well.
