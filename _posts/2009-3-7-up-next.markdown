Last year, I completed a simple commerce website where I used my own solution written in rails. It worked, but it was a very simple application, not much flare, not much ajax (which is omg exciting). So for this, it would've wound up being a little too simplistic, and to avoid having to reinvent the square wheel, I tried using substruct. Substruct is great for what it is, but it hasn't been updated in some time now, so I tried redoing it with spree, and that's where I am now. The transition has been pretty smooth since I had finished most of the views already. As far as the functionality, it seems like a winner! Huzzah.
