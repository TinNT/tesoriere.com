I recently finished a web site for <a href="http://drstitsky.com/">Dr. Lorne L. Stitsky</a>, for his personal practice. His slogan is, "putting the care back into healthcare... one house call at a time". It's not just a marketing ploy either, he actually makes housecalls. I designed and developed the site, it uses <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> as a backend and <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox</a> for the gallery.

<b>Update</b>: the site is pending a redesign to match Dr Stitsky's new theme. The website was created before he had a theme set in mind.
