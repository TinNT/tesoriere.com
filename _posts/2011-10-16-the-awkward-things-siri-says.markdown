## A quick example of how easy nodejs easy to get up and running

I'll go into detail later, but essentially, this site uses [nodejs][1], [expressjs][2], [railwayjs][3], [knox][4] for s3 uploads, a [redis][5] session store, and a [mongodb][6] backend via [mongoose][6].

[Site][8] [can be found][9] [here][7].

## Questions?

You might have some questions, and I can answer them! I'll post some how-to's soon.
