## Seeing this error?

This is a simple one to fix. I had two Classes of the same name but with different scopes, one was a model and the other a class in a separate module under lib. You have three options in this scenario:

1. Choose more appropriate names

2. Move the module out of lib into a gem

3. Rename the filename of the Class under the lib/ folder, while retaining the same class name.
