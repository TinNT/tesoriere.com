## Update:

New drivers can be found [here at my latest article about the GTX 460](/2011/03/28/random-freeze-fix-for-gtx-460-in-10.6--osx86-/), and solved most of my problems with random freezes

## But... But... That's illegal! 

Actually, no, it's not. I'm not selling, nor condoning the use or creation of a hackintosh. If you however, are a hobbyist and are curious, the **GTX 460** family of nVidia graphic cards now work in Snow Leopard (osx86). 

All one has to do is [go here][1] and [download the latest drivers for Snow Leopard][1]. This, however, requires you to update to 10.6.5, and use an appropriate boot loader with the following in com.apple.boot.plist:

    <key>GraphicsEnabler</key>
		<string>Yes</string>
