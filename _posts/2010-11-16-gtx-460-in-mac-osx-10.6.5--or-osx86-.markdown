## Completely rid yourself of freezes!

While I had no more random freezes in 10.6.*, upgrading to Lion allowed for full stability and full use of graphics acceleration via OpenCL/CUDA/OpenGL. So please, upgrade to Lion, go purchase it on the App Store. [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12)


## But... But... That's illegal! 

Actually, no, it's not. I'm not selling, nor condoning the use or creation of a hackintosh. If you however, are a hobbyist and are curious, the **GTX 460** family of nVidia graphic cards now work in Snow Leopard (osx86). 

All one has to do is [go here][1] and [download the latest drivers for Snow Leopard][1]. This, however, requires you to update to 10.6.5, and use an appropriate boot loader with the following in com.apple.boot.plist:

    <key>GraphicsEnabler</key>
		<string>Yes</string>
