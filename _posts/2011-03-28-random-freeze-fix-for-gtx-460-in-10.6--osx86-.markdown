## So far, anyway!

Newly released drivers for the Quadro 4000 for Mac can be used for the GTX 460, and this combination with 10.6.7 and Chameleon rc750 have completely removed any random freezes thus far. The system has been running for 24 hours now. 

## But it still locks up :(

Ultimately, if you still have freezes, consider going [here](http://apple.com) and buying one of [these](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/mac_mini). If that's not the way you want to spend your money, then go [here](http://ebay.com) and looking for one of [these](http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/ati-radeon-hd-5000/hd-5870/Pages/ati-radeon-hd-5870-overview.aspx), which work without issue, without injection in OSX 10.6.7.
