<b>Below this is all tech-talk.</b> To summarize, I used new stuff to make the site better, make it quicker, and more responsive. <a href="http://keepflippin.com">This is what I made.</a>

In every project I do, I like to learn something new. This time, I just happened to learn quite a few new things, <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html">SASS</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>, and additional knowledge about PHP to name a few. Not that PHP is still anything amazing, but it can't hurt to renew some knowledge of it.

The <a href="http://keepflippin.com">new keep flippin website</a> is built using <a href="http://compass-style.org/">compass</a> for the CSS (this is <em>amazing</em>), <a href="http://symphony-cms.com">symphony</a>, some <a href="http://tesoriere.com/tags/symphony%20extension">extensions I created</a> and <a href="http://github.com/scottkf">GitHub</a> to keep track of everything.
