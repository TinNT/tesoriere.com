## New Hotness (updated)

I've recently changed the Schedule page, and a hidden, non-publicly page, to use a Rails Application as a 'data-source' to provide the Schedule of classes, as well as other stuff on that non-public page.  This was done in an effort to help ease the transition between the software that Keep Flippin' currently uses to manage itself, and the new software I will be writing. More will follow in the coming months!

## Old and Busted (original)

<b>Below this is all tech-talk.</b> To summarize, I used new stuff to make the site better, make it quicker, and more responsive. <a href="http://keepflippin.com">This is what I made.</a>

The <a href="http://keepflippin.com">new keep flippin website</a> is built using <a href="http://compass-style.org/">compass</a> for the CSS (this is <em>amazing</em>), <a href="http://symphony-cms.com">symphony</a>, some <a href="http://tesoriere.com/tags/symphony%20extension">extensions I created</a>, <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html">SASS</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a> and <a href="http://github.com/scottkf">GitHub</a> to keep track of everything.
